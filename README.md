# Multi-hop Assortativities For Networks Classification

## Abstract
Several social, medical, engineering and biological challenges rely on discovering the functionality of
networks from their structure and node metadata, when is available. For example, in chemoinformatics
one might want to detect whether a molecule is toxic based on structure and atomic types, or discover the
research field for scientific collaboration networks.
Existing techniques rely on counting or measuring structural patterns that are known to show large vari-
ations from network to network, such as number of triangles, or the assortativity of node metadata. We
introduce the concept of multi-hop assortativity, that captures the similarity of node situated at the extrem-
ities of a randomly selected path of a given length. We show that multi-hop assortativity unifies various
existing concepts and offers a versatile family of ‘fingerprints’ to characterize networks. These finger-
prints allow in turn to recover the functionalities of a network, with the help of the machine learning
toolbox.
Our method is evaluated empirically on established social and chemoinformatic network benchmarks.
Results reveal that our assortativity based features are competitive providing highly accurate results often
outperforming state of the art methods for the network classification task.
